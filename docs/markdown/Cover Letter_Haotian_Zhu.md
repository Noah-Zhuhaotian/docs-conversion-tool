Verifone

Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand

Dear Hiring Team,

I am Haotian Zhu, with over nine years of experience specialising in building scalable cloud solutions, designing CI/CD pipelines, and automating workflows, I’m excited to apply for Verifone’s Senior DevOps Engineer role\.

Throughout my career, my experience spans multiple cloud platforms \(AWS, Azure,  Alibaba Cloud\) and has equipped me with a versatile understanding of DevOps principles that align perfectly with Verifone's needs\. I have consistently designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using tools such as AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, reducing deployment times and minimising manual intervention\. I've deployed containerised applications to Kubernetes environments, ensuring scalability and reliability across multiple environments with 99\.99% uptime\. 

Additionally, I've established comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions using tools mentioned in your job description—Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack—significantly improving issue detection and reducing incident resolution times by over 35%\. My experience with Infrastructure as Code \(using Terraform, Ansible, and Bicep\) has consistently accelerated provisioning while ensuring environment consistency and security compliance\. My extensive experience with security practices would enable me to hit the ground running in this role\. I am also highly collaborative and enjoy mentoring others in DevOps best practices, which I understand is an important aspect of this position\.

I am particularly drawn to Verifone's 30\-year record of leadership in the electronic payment technology industry and your focus on innovation\. The opportunity to work on cutting\-edge payment solutions that process billions of transactions annually is genuinely exciting to me\. I am eager to contribute to your evolution from traditional application support to modern platform engineering functions\.

My partner and I live in Wellington and hold a three\-year open work visa\. We are hoping to build a long\-term future here\. This role feels like a perfect match, and I’d love to learn more about the Verifone's platform engineering initiatives and discuss how my skills can contribute to Verifone's mission\.

Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to hearing from you\.

Best regards,  
Haotian Zhu
