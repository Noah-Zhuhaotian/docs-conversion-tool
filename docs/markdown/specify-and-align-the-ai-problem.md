Specify and align the AI Problem

About this activity

Specification alignment describes the ability to guide an AI system towards an intended

outcome. For AI systems to be successful, it’s important to define the purpose of the

system. This can help you align the AI system’s behaviors with your users’ intentions:

1. Meet as a team, look at the existing user research you have, and identify product

behaviors that are natural, useful, beneficial, and safe for users.

2. First, define the primary goal that your AI product/feature will solve for your users.

3. Then, identify the sub-goals that people must solve before or while addressing the

larger problem.

4. Then, articulate parts of the problem that are frequently under-specified.

Specify and Align the AI Problem

5.  Finally, brainstorm some varied ways to optimize your problem.

Throughout this exercise, the engineering team should identify the model specifications to

build AI systems that align with expected behaviors identified by the user experience team.

At the end of this exercise your team should have a clear understanding of what

constitutes an AI solution that is worth pursuing, and why.

Before you begin:

●  Block out time to get as many cross-functional leads as possible together in a

room to work through these exercises together.

●  The person responsible for user research should aggregate existing evidence

for the team to reference in this and subsequent exercises. Complete and share

the user research summary with cross-functional leads and activity

stakeholders ahead of time.

User Needs + Defining Success

Specify and Align the AI Problem

1. Primary goal

Identify your user’s primary goal. Then, translate this into specific tasks or outcomes that

your AI system needs to successfully and reliably accomplish to help users meet their goal.

Primary Goal

What problem should we

Our user’s primary goal is

solve for people with our

product or application?

What is the user’s primary

goal? What does the user

want the AI system to do for

them to help them meet their

goals?

To meet their goals, our AI system must

2. Sub-goals

Consider the ecosystem of decisions and dependencies that surround your primary goal.

Identify the sub-goals that people must solve before or while addressing the primary goal.

Evaluate if and why these may be consistent or inconsistent with the primary goal.

What sub-goals must
people solve before or
while addressing the
larger problem?

What are the alternate goals,
dependencies, or
sub-problems that users
break problems down into?
What skills are required or
what ancillary problems must
users address before
addressing the larger
problem?

Are these consistent with
the primary goal that the
user wants solved?

Sub-goal

Sub-goals the user must address before addressing

the primary goal:

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

Sub-goals the user must address while addressing the

primary goal:

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

●  { sub-goal } _________________________

These sub-goals are { consistent or

inconsistent } with the primary goal because

3. Underspecification

Articulate parts of the problem that are frequently under-specified, assumed, or simply

overlooked, but may be critical to the solution. Repeat this as many times as necessary.

Underspecification

What parts of the problem do
people frequently under-specify?

Consider frequently-made
assumptions, tasks that are difficult to
articulate or explain, and expectations
and contextual cues that may not be
visible to your AI product or feature.

If ___ { attribute of primary goal } ___

is underspecified or unknown, it can result in

_____ { negative consequence } _____

tasks that are difficult to articulate or
explain, and expectations and
contextual cues that may not be visible
to your AI product or feature.

4. Optimization

Misalignment between user intent and the AI system can cause an AI system to learn an

unintended goal and competently pursue that goal in a new situation, also known as

“reward hacking”. Brainstorm some varied ways to optimize your problem. Consider if

optimizing for one sub-goal can compromise another.

Optimization

Can optimizing one sub-goal
result in a compromise for
others?

What are some varied ways to
optimize the problem? Can the AI
system confuse the varied
problems and learn harmful
behaviors?
